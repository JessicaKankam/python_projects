# python_projects
This repository contains Python projects completed as part of a graduate-level **Marketing Analytics** course as well as personal projects.

The projects focus on applying data analytics techniques to real-world marketing problems, including:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Predictive modeling (regression + classification)
- Clustering
- Business interpretation and recommendations
- Data-driven storytelling for business decision-making

Each project is organized in its own folder and includes:
- A Google Colab Notebook ('.ipynb')
- Supporting datasets
- A brief project-specific README explaining the business question, approach, and key insights

**Tools & Libraries:**  
- **Data analysis:** pandas, numpy
- **Statistics & econometrics:** scipy.stats, statsmodels (api, formula.api), variance_inflation_factor
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn, plotnine (ggplot-style)
- **Machine learning (scikit-learn):**
  - Preprocessing: ColumnTransformer, OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler
  - Model selection: train_test_split, cross_val_score, KFold
  - Models: LinearRegression, Lasso, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier
  - Metrics: mean_squared_error, accuracy_score, confusion_matrix
  - Clustering: KMeans
  - Tree visualization: plot_tree
